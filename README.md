# Deep-Learning-2

This course involved just the final project which involved sentiment style transfer of highly polar, unpaired IMDB text reviews. I approached this problem using transformers and CycleGANs. The approach with CycleGANs was not successful, but I was able to get the Transformer model working. Accompanying paper can be made available upon request.
